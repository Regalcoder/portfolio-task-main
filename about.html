                <div class="about-item">
                    <p>I have always had the passion to be a software developer/programmer
                        and coupled with my love for art i decided to channel my passion into web development.
                    I first started my journey in 2015 where i interned with a family friend of mine who taught me 
                coding (JAVA) for 6 months, an internship process i found very confusing.
                 This unpleasantlearning experience coupled with other factors detered me from oursuing my passion for another
                five to six years when i would later pick up my passion again encouraged by my "tech bro" friends. I haven't looked
            back since then.   </p>
                        <p>I have worked with languages like react js, next js and vanilla js. I'm currently looking at adding wordpress and redux to my skill set</p> 
                            <p>In a few years time i hope to be a skilled developer working on life changing projects that would bring impacting changes across Africa.
                                I also hope to be in the fintech sector either as an owner or a team member helping to build solutions to issues in the finance sector using tech
                            </p>
                            <p>When I'm not coding im either trading crypto currency, playing Fifa on my playstation 4 console or just scrolling through my phone.</p>
